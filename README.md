## Requirements:
- https://github.com/apenasrr/zipind
- https://github.com/apenasrr/telegram_filesender


## How to use
- Place the folder of the 2 required repositories and this repository in the same location. Then there must be 3 folders in the same location: zipsender, zipind, Telegram_filesender
- Enter the 'config.ini' file and place in the chat_id variable, the channel/group_ID destination to send all files
- Enter 'zipsender' folder
- Just for this first time, run update_libs.bat to update required libs
- and run both files zipsender_send.bat and zipsender_zip.bat
- Note that a new folder will appear: '\zipsender\1-tozip'
- Paste in this folder, an audio-visual collection folder
- To authorize this folder to start processing, Rename this collection folder by adding an underline character at the beginning of your name
- Wait for the collection to be processed and sent automatically
- You can put several collections in the '1-Tozip' folder and authorize the process for all of them quickly by running the 'auth_all_folders.bat' file

For more details to customizations, soon in documentation.
